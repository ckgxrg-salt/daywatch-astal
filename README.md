# Daywatch Astal
Astal configuration for my primary laptop.   
I have a dual-screen model, so this setup consists a bottom dashboard, a bar and a logout menu.   
Normally the dashboard, which has more functions, would be displayed, but when a window is summoned at the bottom screen, the dashboard hides and the bar appears, maxmising space for the windows.   
I made this using the beautiful everforest palette.
